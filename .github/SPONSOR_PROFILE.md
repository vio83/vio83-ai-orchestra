# 🎵 Sponsor VIO 83 AI ORCHESTRA

## Hi, I'm PadronaVio 👋

I'm an independent developer building **VIO 83 AI Orchestra** — the world's first intelligent multi-AI orchestration platform.

### The Vision

Imagine one app that gives you access to **every top AI model in the world** — Claude, GPT-4, Grok, Mistral, DeepSeek — with an intelligent system that automatically picks the best model for each question. Plus local models via Ollama for 100% offline, privacy-first usage.

No more switching between tabs. No more paying for 5 subscriptions. No more trusting AI without verification.

### Why I Need Your Support

I'm building this **alone**, on a MacBook Air M1 with 8GB RAM. Every day I push the limits of what this little machine can do. Your sponsorship helps me:

1. **🖥 Upgrade to a Mac Studio M4 Ultra** (192GB RAM) — This is the #1 priority. With proper hardware, I can run and test larger AI models locally, develop faster, and deliver more features.

2. **💰 Cover API costs** — Testing Claude, GPT-4, Grok, Mistral, and DeepSeek costs real money. Every test run has a price tag.

3. **⏰ Work on this full-time** — More hours = faster releases, more features, better quality.

4. **🌍 Keep it open source** — I believe the best AI tools should be accessible to everyone, forever.

### What You Get

- **Your name in the README** and contributor list
- **Early access** to new features before public release
- **Priority feature requests** — tell me what you need
- **Direct communication** — I actually respond to every sponsor
- **The satisfaction** of funding indie open-source development

### The Numbers

| What | Cost |
|------|------|
| Mac Studio M4 Ultra (192GB) | ~€5,000 |
| Monthly API testing budget | ~€50/month |
| Apple Developer Certificate | €99/year |
| Domain + hosting | ~€15/month |

**Goal: €5,200** — enough for the Mac Studio + 2 months of runway.

Every contribution, no matter how small, is deeply appreciated. Even €3/month adds up when the community comes together.

### Thank You 💚

To everyone who believes in this project — **grazie di cuore**. You're not just funding software. You're funding a vision where AI is transparent, verified, and accessible to everyone.
